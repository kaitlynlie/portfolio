              My love for tech started early, when I created goofy little storytelling games as a kid using Donacode â€” a Scratch-like language that made me feel like a 10-year-old game dev prodigy.
              Unfortunately, none of my epic adventures ever went viral, but the joy of building never left me.
              <br /><br />
              Fast forward to today, I've had the privilege of working at&nbsp;
              <a href="https://aggieworks.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
                a student-led organization building real products
              </a>
              &nbsp;and&nbsp;
              <a href="https://order.thepantry.ucdavis.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
                a food pantry website ensuring no student is hungry
              </a>
              .
              <br /><br />
              Currently, I work as a Technical Specialist at Foxit Software, where I provide support and solutions to enhance user experience. I'm grateful for the chance to learn, innovate, and build for real users.
              <br /><br />
              Outside of work, you'll usually find me with a book, binge-watching C-dramas, or going on walks, but I'm still holding out hope for that sleeper hit.
